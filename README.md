# Bus Network Simulator

## Programming language
I picked Python as my programming language because it's nice. I used version 2.6.8 because that is the one DiCE machines have.

## Current state
Right now, the simulator should work on valid input files. That is, it does not do any sort of validation.

### Running the simulator
To run the simulator just run `python run.py` in the simulator directory.

### Optional arguments
You can supply optional arguments:
1. input file - `python run.py tests/test1`
2. output file - `python run.py tests/test1 out.txt`
